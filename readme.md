## Description
Upon opening the webpage, you will be greeted by a kind robot by the name of Beepy McBoopFace. There are two input forms that need to be completed in order for Beepy's computation to initialize. The first input form prompts the user for their name, and the second form prompts the user to enter a number. Depending on whether or not the number provided by the user contains certain individual numbers or is divisible by a particular number, Beepy will output a different message.
Here are the conditions in which Beepy operates:
- Beepy says, "Beep!" --> if the number contains a "0"
- Beepy says, "Boop!" --> if the number contians a "1"
- Beepy says, "I'm sorry, (User's Name). I'm afraid I can't do that" --> if the number is divisible by "3"
- Beepy says, "Oops, you forgot to enter a number." --> if the number form is empty.
- Beepy says, "Oops, you forgot to enter your name." --> if the name form is empty.
